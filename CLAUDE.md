# kens-discord-bot

A Discord.js v14 bot boilerplate in TypeScript with automatic command/event handlers, AI integration via Groq, ready for Railway deployment.

## Organization Rules

**Keep code organized and modularized:**
- Commands → `src/commands/<category>/`, one command per file
- Events → `src/events/`, one event per file
- Features → `src/features/`, one feature per file
- Utilities → `src/utils/`, grouped by functionality
- Types → `src/types/`

**See `docs/` folder for detailed guides on adding:**
- Commands, Events, Features, AI, Storage, Scheduled Tasks, Embeds/Buttons

## Auto-Commit Rule

After completing any feature or significant code change, automatically commit and push to GitHub so Railway can deploy.

## Code Quality - Zero Tolerance

After editing ANY file, run:

```bash
npm run check
```

This runs typecheck + lint (includes Prettier formatting checks).

Fix ALL errors/warnings before continuing.

## Quick Reference

```bash
npm run dev              # Development with hot reload
npm run deploy-commands  # Register slash commands
npm run check            # Type check + lint
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix lint issues
```
